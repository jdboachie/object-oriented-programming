# COE254 - Object-Oriented Programming with C++

Welcome to the COE254 repository for Object-Oriented Programming with C++! This repository is created to showcase your code and provide a platform for collaboration and contributions from the community. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing object-oriented programming concepts using the C++ programming language.

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects and classes to structure and organize code. This repository allows you to showcase your projects and assignments related to the COE254 course taught by Professor Theresa-Samuelle Adjaidoo, and it also encourages contributions from others interested in object-oriented programming with C++.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

* Projects: This directory is where you can showcase your projects related to object-oriented programming in C++. You can create subdirectories for each project and include a README file within each directory to provide an overview and instructions on running or using the project.

* Assignments: Here, you can share your assignments completed as part of the COE254 course. Similar to the projects directory, you can create subdirectories for each assignment, including relevant code files and a README with instructions and explanations.

* Contributions: This directory is meant for community contributions. Others can submit their own examples, projects, or improvements to existing code. Encourage contributors to follow the guidelines in the ![CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jdboachie/object-oriented-programming/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file when making contributions.
Feel free to create additional directories or modify the existing structure based on your specific needs.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/jdboachie/object-oriented-programming.git
```

2. Familiarize yourself with the repository structure and its purpose. This will help you understand how to organize and contribute your own code effectively.

3. If you would like to contribute to existing code or collaborate with others, review the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on submitting contributions.

4. Explore the existing projects and assignments shared by others. Feel free to provide feedback, suggestions, or improvements through issues or pull requests.

## Contributions

This repository is open to contributions from the community. If you would like to contribute your own code, examples, projects, or improvements, follow the guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file. Contributions can include bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, or additional examples related to ![Dr. Theresa]('s object-oriented programming in C++.
Collaborative efforts will enhance the repository and provide a valuable resource for learning and exploring object-oriented programming concepts with C++.
